# **Turbo Playground**
Turbo Playground is a safe place to play with Turbo (and by proxy, Hotwire). I mainly use it to test out new navigation tricks like morphing or Action Cable broadcasts, getting modals rights, etc.

## **Get Up and Running**

### **Pre-requisites:**
You'll need to have Ruby, Node, and Yarn installed on your machine. I recommend going with [RVM](https://rvm.io/) and [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) but you do you.

### **Install Homebrew:**
[Get it here](https://brew.sh/)

```sh
$ bundle
$ yarn install
```

### **Setup the Database:**
```sh
$ rails db:setup
```

### **Run the App:**

```

### **Open it:**
Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
